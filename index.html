	<h1>Graduate Researcher – Andrea Chiba Lab – August 2015 – Present </h1>
	<p>Worked with Professor Andrea Chiba and Dr. Laleh Quinn on a goal-oriented reinforcement learning paradigm where rodents learn how to control robotic agents. I have managed multiple groups of students, research scientists, post-docs, and electrical/mechanical/control engineers to acquire behavioral/neural data then analyze that data using statistics, probabilistic modeling, dynamical systems analysis and machine learning techniques.</a></p>
